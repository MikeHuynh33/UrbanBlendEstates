# Real Estate and Restaurant Review Application

Welcome to our creative collaboration project that merges a real estate application with a restaurant review application, combining the best of both worlds. This README provides an overview of the project, the steps taken for integration, and instructions for getting started.

## Overview

This project is a creative fusion of a real estate application and a restaurant review application, creating a comprehensive platform that allows users to explore properties and discover local dining options. By merging these two domains, we aim to provide users with a versatile and engaging experience to explore local community before they make a purchase.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the development environment and get the project running on your machine:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   - Clone the repository of the ASP.NET project to your local machine using a Git client or the command line.

2. **Open the Project in Visual Studio:**
   - Open Visual Studio.
   - Go to `File` > `Open` > `Project/Solution` and navigate to the cloned project's directory to open the solution file (usually ending in `.sln`).

3. **Open Package Manager Console:**
   - In Visual Studio, go to `Tools` > `NuGet Package Manager` > `Package Manager Console`.

4. **Select Default Project:**
   - At the top of the NuGet Package Manager Console, make sure you select the correct project (the one with your Entity Framework DbContext) from the "Default Project" dropdown list.

5. **Run Migrations and Update Database:**
   - Run the migration command to create and apply migrations:
     ```
     Add-Migration InitialCreate
     ```
   - This command will create a migration based on the changes detected in your DbContext.
   - After creating the migration, run the update database command to apply the migration and update the database schema:
     ```
     Update-Database
     ```
   - This command applies any pending migrations to the database.

6. **Run the Project:**
   - Build and run the project in Visual Studio to see the changes reflected in your application.

Remember to have a solid understanding of your existing database schema and the changes you're making before running migrations. Communication with your team is important, especially in a collaborative environment, to avoid conflicts and ensure everyone is aware of database changes.


## Database Integration

The real estate and restaurant review databases were integrated using a unified database approach. We migrated the relevant data from both applications into a single database instance, ensuring data consistency and smooth integration of features.

## Code Integration

The codebases of the real estate and restaurant review applications were meticulously merged, keeping in mind naming conflicts and compatibility. We reused common components, such as authentication systems and UI elements, to create a seamless user experience.

## UI Integration

The UI elements of the merged application maintain a consistent design language while seamlessly blending real estate and restaurant review functionalities. We employed a responsive design approach to ensure a consistent experience across different devices.

## Functionality Integration

The merged application brings together the functionalities of both domains. Users can explore property listings and read restaurant reviews within the same platform. Special care was taken to ensure that these functionalities interact smoothly without any disruptions.

## Testing

We conducted extensive testing, including unit tests, integration tests, and user acceptance testing. This rigorous testing approach helped us identify and rectify any bugs or inconsistencies, ensuring the stability and reliability of the application.

## Deployment

To deploy the application to your localhost environment:

1. Update the database connection settings in the `config.js` file to match your localhost configuration.
2. Run the database migration scripts to ensure the database schema is up to date: `npm run migrate`.
3. Launch the application using `npm start`.

## Localhost Migration

Migrating the application to your localhost involves updating the necessary configurations to match your local environment. Ensure that connection strings, API endpoints, and database settings are correctly configured for your localhost setup.

## Bug Fixing and Optimization

During testing, we addressed various bugs and optimized the application's performance. We analyzed and improved critical components to ensure the application is responsive and efficient.

## Documentation
